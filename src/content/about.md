## About me

![Peter speaking at RenderConf 2018](/images/pages/about/peter-renderconf-2018.jpg)

Hi! I'm a front-end developer at an employee-owned retailer in the UK.

I've been a developer since graduating in 2003 and mostly developing for the web since 2005. I've previously worked in a "future technologies" lab at an education company and as a tech lead at a national newspaper and two web development agencies. For over two years I was a developer advocate for [Samsung Internet](https://samsunginter.net), Samsung's mobile web browser ([which may be bigger than you think!](https://medium.com/samsung-internet-dev/think-you-know-the-top-web-browsers-458a0a070175)). Now I'm [enjoying working for an employee-owned organisation](https://medium.com/john-lewis-software-engineering/5-reasons-i-love-being-a-software-developer-at-the-john-lewis-partnership-and-you-might-too-c0c0ec181efa) and helping to lead our front-end community.

I have a particular interest in tech ethics. At the organisation where I work, I set up an "ethics &amp; sustainability" community where we've hosted presentations on topics such as the circular economy and consumer attitudes to sustainability. I also kicked off an accessibility community, which I've since passed on to others to lead, but I'm always keen to promote accessibility, for example through our design system components. I'm also keen to help improve our web performance, to help our customers and to help [save waste](https://alistapart.com/article/webwaste/). I'm currently working on re-architecting our website with micro-frontends, which we expect to have a large performance benefit.

I'm a founder and co-organiser of [Berkshire JS](https://www.meetup.com/BerkshireJS) (we haven't hosted a meetup for a while, but hopefully we will sometime again in the future!) I'm a member of [Climate Tech](https://climate-tech.slack.com) and the [Green Party](https://greenparty.org.uk).
