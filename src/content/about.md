## About me

![Peter speaking at RenderConf 2018](/images/pages/about/peter-renderconf-2018.jpg)

Hi! I'm a front-end developer at an employee-owned retailer in the UK.

I've been a developer since graduating in 2003 and mostly developing for the web since 2005. I've previously worked in a "future technologies" lab at an education company and as a tech lead at a national newspaper and two web development agencies. For over two years I was a developer advocate for [Samsung Internet](https://samsunginter.net), Samsung's mobile web browser ([which may be bigger than you think!](https://medium.com/samsung-internet-dev/think-you-know-the-top-web-browsers-458a0a070175)). Now I'm [enjoying working for an employee-owned organisation](https://medium.com/john-lewis-software-engineering/5-reasons-i-love-being-a-software-developer-at-the-john-lewis-partnership-and-you-might-too-c0c0ec181efa) and helping to lead our front-end community. I co-organised [Berkshire JS](https://www.meetup.com/BerkshireJS) which hosted a couple of meetups before a combination of parenthood and covid put an end to it!

I have an interest in tech ethics. At the organisation where I work, I set up an "ethics &amp; sustainability" community where we've hosted presentations on topics such as the circular economy and consumer attitudes to sustainability. I also kicked off an accessibility community, which I've since passed on to others to lead, but I'm always keen to promote accessibility, for example through our design system components. I'm also keen to help improve our web performance, to help our customers and to help [save waste](https://alistapart.com/article/webwaste/). I've helped to lead our move to micro-frontends, which have given us performance and delivery benefits.

Outside of technology, I bought myself a piano for my 40th birthday and taught myself how to play some pieces that I really love. I've started putting [recordings of them here on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@PeterOShaughnessy/search?query=piano) if you're interested.
