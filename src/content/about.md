## About me

Hi! I'm a front-end developer at an employee-owned retailer in the UK.

I've been a developer since graduating in 2003 and mostly developing for the web since 2005. I've previously worked in a "future technologies" lab at an education company and as a tech lead at a national newspaper and two web development agencies. For over two years I was a developer advocate for [Samsung Internet](https://samsunginter.net), Samsung's mobile web browser ([which may be bigger than you think!](https://medium.com/samsung-internet-dev/think-you-know-the-top-web-browsers-458a0a070175)). I co-organised [Berkshire JS](https://www.meetup.com/BerkshireJS) which hosted a couple of meetups before a combination of parenthood and covid put an end to it! Now I'm [enjoying working for an employee-owned organisation](https://medium.com/john-lewis-software-engineering/5-reasons-i-love-being-a-software-developer-at-the-john-lewis-partnership-and-you-might-too-c0c0ec181efa) as a senior front-end engineer.

I have an interest in tech ethics. At the organisation where I work, I created and co-organise an "ethics &amp; sustainability" community where we've hosted virtual presentations. I'm keen on accessibility and performance, and I've helped to lead our move to micro-frontends, which has given us performance and delivery benefits.

Around November 2025, I became very concerned about [the race to Artificial General Intelligence](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2025/dec/01/its-going-much-too-fast-the-inside-story-of-the-race-to-create-the-ultimate-ai) and I decided to focus a lot of my attention on it from now on.

Outside of technology, I bought myself a piano for my 40th birthday and taught myself how to play some pieces that I really love. I've started putting [recordings of them here on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@PeterOShaughnessy/search?query=piano) if you're interested.
