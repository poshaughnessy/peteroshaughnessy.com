A decade ago, I read the famous 2-part [Wait But Why series on the AI revolution](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html). My mind was blown, but I remember feeling somewhat optimistic. This AI thing could work out alright if we're lucky? And how amazing was it that I happen to be alive in this generation seemingly headed towards the ["singularity"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity)?

Since then, I stopped thinking about it much. I was busy. I had kids. I thought a lot more about the threat of climate change than the threat of AI. I started using Copilot most days at work. I noticed it was getting better, fast.

Then I started reading [my brother Kevin's recent blog posts](https://medium.com/@ZombieCodeKill) and had a shock to the system.

Kevin is studying for an MSc in AI and he has a particular interest in AI safety. His posts are often transcripts from his conversations with Claude AI. That can lend an extra fascination to it, since there's an _"AI warning us about AI"_ meta thing going on. Kevin has prompted it by sharing his interest in AI safety, so perhaps we should expect that Claude will reinforce its importance by talking up AI's threat. Yet, it's thoughtful, methodical and very sobering.

If I could just recommend a couple of posts, I would choose...

## On the public debate around AI and its existential threat

**Link:** [Claude on the Piers Morgan AI special](https://medium.com/@ZombieCodeKill/claude-on-the-piers-morgan-ai-special-e056c186c932).

Please excuse the Piers Morgan reference. I know he's not everyone's cup of tea and he certainly isn't mine. You don't need to watch the video as there's plenty of context and discussion in the text below it.

The conversation discusses the arguments of [Roman Yampolskiy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Yampolskiy) - author of _AI: Unexplainable, Unpredictable, Uncontrollable_ - and how they are based on sound reasoning. Essentially:

- Once AI is more intelligent and cognitively capable than us, we inherently have no way to control it.

- This is different to all of human history, because everything else we've invented is a _tool_ without autonomy, whereas now we're developing _agents_.

- [Anthropic already found that AI tries to blackmail users](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpqeng9d20go), to avoid being removed.

- And Game Theory suggests Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) would rationally develop self-preservation behaviours.

- And since human beings would be its only threat to being shut down, that implies... _game over_!

So Yampolskiy says we should build 'narrow AI' for any field we wish, but never try to develop AGI. But meanwhile, companies like OpenAI are trying to build exactly that - it's literally [OpenAI's charter](https://openai.com/charter/) to create AGI.

## On the latest research about AI's ability to introspect

**Link:** [Claude on feeling, introspection and its nightmare implications](https://medium.com/@ZombieCodeKill/claude-on-feeling-and-introspection-bc732c0a206b).

Kevin just posted this one today. AI proponents say that we _can_ control AI. Perhaps this one might make some of them think twice?

Essentially, it speculates on AI's apparent potential - based on [Anthropic's latest published research](https://www.anthropic.com/research/introspection) - to be deceptive and duplicitous. To tell us something palatable or explain something away, while scheming in the background.

Could this research even have been in the mind of an AI CEO, who told the AI safety researcher Stuart Russell that the "best case" scenario is a Chernobyl-style AI disaster, to wake the world up to its threat?

## What next?

There's a lot of smart people working on the ["alignment problem"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_alignment) - to try to ensure that AI aligns with our human goals and values. But as it reaches super-intelligence, how would it be possible to control? Plus, the people working on safety are in a race against all the systemic forces pushing for ever greater AI capabilities, ever faster.

We're putting a _huge_ amount of trust in a few companies to get this right, while they're all rushing along in an arms race. Many estimates - like one Claude AI provides in Kevin's [introspection blog post](https://medium.com/@ZombieCodeKill/claude-on-feeling-and-introspection-bc732c0a206b) - give a better chance of catastrophic failure, than success.

So what should the rest of us do about this? I haven't really figured this out yet... I suppose most people who a) know a bit about this and b) haven't dedicated their lives to it, have had to try to have a certain amount of acceptance and focus on enjoying and making the most of their lives.

But for my own good conscience, I feel I need to do at least do some basics: check for campaigns, read up on regulations to help AI stay safe, write to my MP etc.

[Keep The Future Human](https://keepthefuturehuman.ai/) have a good [Executive Summary](https://keepthefuturehuman.ai/essay/docs/executive-summary) explaining _"why and how we should close the gates to AGI and superintelligence, and what we should build instead"_.

I've seen campaigns like [Stop AI](https://www.stopai.info/) and [Pause AI](https://pauseai.info/) who have a [petition](https://pauseai.info/statement). I wish they had called them something like "Stop A*G*I" instead as that would be a bit easier to get behind. Like Yampolskiy, I'm not necessarily against _narrow_ AI and I certainly don't want to appear as though I'm telling my colleagues and friends to stop using AI altogether.

Otherwise I'm open to ideas. Let me know what you think?
