### What I've been reading, listening to and watching, to understand AI's dangers and what to do about it

Reading the [blog posts from my brother Kevin](https://medium.com/@ZombieCodeKill) who is studying for an MSc in AI, I have recently become very concerned about the "[race to AGI](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2025/dec/01/its-going-much-too-fast-the-inside-story-of-the-race-to-create-the-ultimate-ai)" (Artificial General Intelligence).

I'm worried about advanced AI [concentrating power for authoritarians](https://www.authoritarian-stack.info/). I'm worried about [mass job losses](https://www.ippr.org/media-office/up-to-8-million-uk-jobs-at-risk-from-ai-unless-government-acts-finds-ippr) without [a suitable safety net](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/15/universal-basic-income-ai-andrew-yang). And I'm worried about the [existential risk](https://www.thecompendium.ai/) of superintelligence, if or when it arrives.

To try to understand the situation better and try to find ideas for how to help, I have spent the past couple of months trying to catch up by reading, watching and listening to _lots and lots_ on AI: how it works, its capabilities and trajectory, near-term safety risks, ethical concerns, the risks of superintelligence and more.

Particularly to help share with colleagues in an Ethics and Sustainability community I co-organise, I have collected a lot of links. I thought I would share them here too, to help anyone else wanting to "speed run" these topics. As [Tristan Harris says](www.ted.com/talks/tristan_harris_why_ai_is_our_ultimate_test_and_greatest_invitation), the best thing we can do to help right now is to try to increase public awareness and clarity.

Given the links are broadly about ethics and safety, there is naturally more of a focus on the dangers of AI. However, I have also been mindful to try to include some counter-arguments and differing views, to help paint a fuller picture - particularly with regard to potential AGI timelines.

I will try to update the list every now and then. Please do not view it as a comprehensive set of topics, but just as a starting point. If you're hoping to catch up like me, or just looking for anything you might have missed, I hope you might find it useful.

<h2 id="capability">1. AI capability and trajectory</h2>

Content to help understand how AI is advancing and how near or far we might be from Artifcial General Inteligence (AGI).

_Note:_ Alternative terms for AGI include “powerful AI” ([Dario Amodei’s preferred term](https://www.darioamodei.com/essay/machines-of-loving-grace#basic-assumptions-and-framework)) and “Higher Level Machine Intelligence” (HLMI, used by the [ESPAI survey](https://wiki.aiimpacts.org/ai_timelines/predictions_of_human-level_ai_timelines/ai_timeline_surveys/2023_expert_survey_on_progress_in_ai), for _“when unaided machines can accomplish every task better and more cheaply than human workers”_). This seems essentially equivalent to the term “strong AGI” used in the [Common Ground between AI 2027 & AI as Normal Technology](https://asteriskmag.substack.com/p/common-ground-between-ai-2027-and) essay (_"AI systems which can... do virtually everything humans can do just as well but faster and cheaper"_).

- _“Development of superhuman machine intelligence is probably the greatest threat to the continued existence of humanity.”_
  - Sam Altman in his [2015 blog post](https://blog.samaltman.com/machine-intelligence-part-1).
- _“AI CEOs claim they know how to build superhuman AI, yet none can show how they'll prevent us from losing control – after which humanity's survival is no longer in our hands. I'm looking for proof that they can reduce the annual risk of control loss to one in a hundred million, in line with nuclear reactor requirements. Instead, they admit the risk could be one in ten, one in five, even one in three, and they can neither justify nor improve those numbers.”_
  - Prof. Stuart Russell, Professor of Computer Science at UC Berkeley
- _"We're currently releasing the most powerful, inscrutable, uncontrollable technology we've ever invented, that's already demonstrating behaviours of self-preservation and deception... We're releasing it faster than we've released any other technology in history, and with the maximum incentive to cut corners on safety."_
  - Tristan Harris, Co-Founder, Center for Humane Tech
- _“AI companies are racing to build technology that they absolutely do not understand and cannot control.”_
  - Steven Adler, former lead safety researcher at OpenAI

### Quotes

- AGI will be _“like a flood of millions of new digital immigrants \[of\] Nobel Prize level capability \[who\] work at superhuman speed \[and\] will work for less than minimum wage.“_
  - Tristan Harris
- _"You know, we had the elevator man, and now we have automated elevators. We had bank tellers, now we have automated teller machines. So humans will always just find something else to do. But why is AI different than that? Because it’s intelligence, because it’s general intelligence. That means that rather than a technology that automates just bank tellers, this is automating all forms of human cognitive labor, meaning everything that a human mind can do. So who’s going to retrain faster? You moving to that other kind of cognitive labor or the AI that is trained on everything and can multiply itself by 100 million times and is retraining how to do that kind of labor?"_
  - Tristan Harris
- Counter-argument: _"I think we live in a very complex, high-friction world where actually intelligence is so multi-dimensional and all this 'replacement' is just incredibly hard and in the real world when you're at the coal face... and humans are just so versatile and so well evolved to deal with the world that we actually live in... I think [AI] will work extraordinarily well in domains that are extraordinarily valuable, but I do not think we're heading for this frictionless, plug-and-play, is-a-human replacement, so I think humans will have comparative advantage in a bunch of things for a very long time."_
