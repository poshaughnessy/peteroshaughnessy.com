    <h1>Turning hacks into products - lessons from Let&#x27;s Code!</h1>
    <p class="date"><time>2nd May 2014</time></p>
    <h3 id="phase-0-the-idea">Phase 0: The idea</h3>
<p>You’ve probably been hearing quite a lot lately about children
learning to code. Interest in the topic has exploded recently, with
initiatives such as the <a href="https://code.org/learn">Hour of
Code</a> and new applications and kits
designed to help teach programming coming out all the time. This is a
post about the process we went through to create our own code-learning
web app, <em><a href="http://www.letsc.de">Let’s Code!</a></em> Along the
way, we learned that it’s great to hack-start a project, but turning
prototypes into products isn’t easy…</p>
<p>The story begins in April 2012. At this time there was an
increasing amount of discussion here in the UK about the ICT
(Information and Communications Technology) curriculum needing to be
modernised. Consensus was growing that we were failing kids by teaching
them only how to use software (like Microsoft
Office) and not how to create it. The existing
curriculum lacked the potential for creativity, it bored students and it
put them off studying Computer Science in higher education. The result
was an <a href="http://readwrite.com/2012/06/07/millennials-arent-so-tech-savvy-after-all">increasingly concerning skills
shortage</a>.</p>
<p>This troublesome situation wasn’t lost on our colleagues, who suggested
that we - Pearson’s <a href="http://labs.pearson.com/prototypes/introducing-pearsons-future-technologies-team-2/">Future Technologies
team</a> - 
might try to do something to help. Since we’re a central R&amp;D team
inside the “world’s leading learning company”, it’s our job to prototype
new concepts and explore new technology that may affect education. At
one of our bi-annual “Future Technologies Champions” meetups, where we
come together with our colleagues to generate ideas for, and decide on,
our next projects, this idea was voted top. So it was decided: we would
create an application to address the IT skills shortage and to help make
ICT fun again.</p>
<h3 id="phase-1-hack-starting-pre-alpha-">Phase 1: Hack-starting (pre-alpha)</h3>
<p>We decided to
“<a href="http://new.livestream.com/digitalshoreditch/events/2104819/videos/19534187">hack-start</a>”
the project, using a hackathon-style format internally to kick things
off quickly. We came together with some of our expert colleagues,
including an ICT subject advisor, and hacked away together in a room for
two days. Over the course of that time, we designed the basics of the
app and created the first, quick prototype.</p>
<p>Some of the decisions we made in this short period of time
were:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To make it as visual as possible and to foster creativity by
allowing young people to create their own applications</p>
</li>
<li><p>To base it around objects that have properties and can move,
as part of real life scenarios that young people can understand and
relate to. For example, the long jump in athletics (the London Games
were just coming up back then!)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We spent most of the first day figuring out what we were going to
do, but by the end of the second day we had hacked away with
<a href="http://www.createjs.com/#!/EaselJS">Easel.js</a>
and created a working long jump demo.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/2014-05-02-turning-hacks-into-products-lets-code/first-prototype.png" alt="First prototype"></p>
<p>Although it was basically useless as an actual application at this point, it was
really useful as a starting point, to convey what we were hoping to
create (both to ourselves, and anyone we spoke to about it).</p>
<h3 id="phase-2-prototyping-alpha-">Phase 2: Prototyping (alpha)</h3>
<p>Following the hack, we archived that code and started developing
again from scratch. (There’s not much harm in throwing away just over a
day’s worth of messy code!).</p>
<p>Over the course of the next few weeks, with help from <a href="https://twitter.com/philpowell">Phil
Powell</a> who joined us for a
few weeks as a contractor, we built an alpha using <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a>. 
It featured most of the core features for the app. It allowed objects to be
added to the stage. You could edit their properties and see the effects.
You could make events trigger things (e.g. hooking up a button click to
make the athlete start running). It included key programming concepts:
objects, properties, methods and events. We also had a couple of
tutorials to guide the user through getting started, although you could
go off-script and do your own thing too.</p>
<p>We got the site <a href="http://pearson-futuretech.github.io/LetsCode">deployed</a>
for anyone to try out and made the code public on <a href="https://github.com/Pearson-FutureTech/LetsCode">GitHub</a>.
We felt that we had conveyed the concept and we started to get some people excited about it.</p>
<p>It felt like our hardest work had been done.</p>
<p>The main problem was that there was no server side component at all. You
couldn’t save your project and if you refreshed the page, you’d go back
to the beginning! Also, we hadn’t spent much time on cross-browser
testing and it didn’t work in Internet Explorer.</p>

<h3 id="phase-3-productizing-beta-">Phase 3: Productizing (beta)</h3>
<p>We were all really keen to see our prototype live on and we wanted
to learn as much as we could about developing an open source project, to
see what lessons we could pass on to other business units in
Pearson.</p>
<p>So we decided to spend more time to “productize” it, i.e. add the
rest of the features it needed to be a minimum viable product. We’d need
to add a server (we chose Node.js) and a database (we chose MongoDB) so
we could store users and projects.</p>
<p>We’re used to creating prototypes (<a href="http://labs.pearson.com/prototypes/">23 so
far</a>, and counting!)
but this was Future Tech’s first experience trying to actually extend
one, beyond our usual 8-10 week timeframe.</p>
<p>Naively, I wasn’t expecting it to be too difficult. I thought that we could
simply build out the alpha and add more features. I did anticipate that
we would need to do some refactoring as we went along, but I didn’t
expect it to be that much work.</p>
<p><strong>Starting again</strong></p>
<p>Because we’re a very small team (just two developers) and always
busy working on multiple new prototypes once, we had
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruchevits">Edward Ruchevits</a> - who had
just joined us as a developer intern on a year out from university -
take on most of the work on this productizing effort.</p>
<p>Edward is a super-smart and knowledgeable developer, but we really
threw him in the deep end on this one! I think that, after being
employed as a developer for a bit over a decade now, I had forgotten how
difficult it is when you first start to work with other people’s code.
Edward was also coding with most of the libraries and technologies (e.g.
Backbone.js, Node.js, MongoDB) for the first time. Furthermore, as I was
basically full-time on my next project, I wasn’t able to spend enough
time with him. So, naturally, Edward didn’t get on well with our fairly
messy alpha code. He decided to create a new version from scratch,
confident that it would actually be quicker that way, because he would
find it easier to work out how things were pieced together.</p>
<p>We were all concerned about starting over again, but we thought
that we would be able to pull in code from the old version as we went
along. Unfortunately, the codebase quickly diverged. As such, soon we
weren’t able to pull in much of the old code at all. </p>
<p>All this meant that a lot of the effort for the beta went into
rewriting features that we already had in the alpha. That was obviously
quite frustrating for all of us.</p>
<p>Edward introduced some great improvements though. He adopted
<a href="http://marionettejs.com/">Marionette</a> which
helped to structure our Backbone code better. He switched to using HTML5
canvas for the stage, instead of DOM elements. And he realised that we
didn’t actually need some of the nastiest code from the alpha, and was
able to remove it.</p>
<p>But gradually we realised that we’d really underestimated the
effort required…</p>
<p><strong>Ramping up</strong></p>
<p>Soon we knew that we’d need some extra help. We asked a London
agency called <a href="https://www.adaptivelab.com/">Adaptive
Lab</a> to work on it with us
for a few weeks.</p>
<p>Adaptive Lab helped to bring a more rigorous approach to
development. They were conscientious about writing tests, they conducted
code reviews and they were great at mentoring Edward.</p>
<p>A little later we were also joined by
<a href="http://thinkgareth.com/">ThinkGareth</a>, who
dropped right in with great expertise in the technologies we were using,
and he helped us all a great deal.</p>
<p><strong>Debugging and wrapping up</strong></p>
<p>Coming to the end of the time we had available, we started
concentrating less on adding/restoring features and more on
debugging.</p>
<p>At this time, we noticed one particular kind of bug kept rearing
its head…</p>
<p>We’re using an Event Aggregator
(<a href="https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.wreqr">Backbone.wreqr</a>)
to de-couple the various components of the app. Instead of calling other
modules directly, you can fire an event which other modules can listen
out for and respond to appropriately.</p>
<p>This is great, except we kept running into bugs caused by accidentally
leaving old event listeners lying around. It’s easy to do; Marionette
Views automatically unbind events you’ve hooked up with
<a href="http://backbonejs.org/#Events-listenTo">listenTo</a> (as opposed to
<a href="http://backbonejs.org/#Events-on">on</a>) when you close the view. But you
can’t do this with the Event Aggregator events; you have to remember to
turn the listeners off in the view ‘close’ methods.</p>
<p>The problems that this caused were very hard to debug, because it
really wasn’t obvious from the fairly random-looking multiple-firing
effects, what the actual causes were. There might be something that
could help with this now though: Chrome debugging tools now have the
ability to <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/async-call-stack/">inspect asynchronous call
stacks</a>.</p>
<p>Eventually, we fixed all the critical bugs that we had identified,
pushed out the source code to
<a href="http://github.com/Pearson-FutureTech/LetsCode-v2">GitHub</a>,
and made the new version
<a href="http://www.letsc.de">live</a>.</p>
<h3 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned</h3>
<p>So what did we learn from this experience?</p>
<p><strong>Hack-start for the win</strong></p>
<p><span
id="docs-internal-guid-b905bf91-bd03-043d-f66e-e8c67d61bbbe">Hack-starting
your project can be a brilliant way to kick things off. It’s amazing how
many important decisions can be made in such as short space of time.
Let’s Code! evolved further along the way, but
we pretty much had the core concept figured out after just two days.
From the direction that gave us, it was relatively easy to then create
our 8-10 week ‘alpha’ prototype. </p>
<p><strong>Prototypes != products</strong></p>
<p>But going from prototype to product is harder. Don’t treat this
lightly - it should be approached just as carefully as any production
build.</p>
<p>Compared to quick hacks and prototypes, doing things properly
takes a lot more time. For production apps (especially open source ones,
where it’s essential that external developers can get up and running as
quickly as possible), you need: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>To think more carefully about the architecture</p>
</li>
<li><p>To adopt automated testing</p>
</li>
<li><p>To spend a lot more time on cross-browser testing and
fixes</p>
</li>
<li><p>To write decent documentation</p>
</li>
<li><p>To use solid development practices, such as conducting code
reviews</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these things can slow down development, but they’re
necessary to ensure the quality of the code, and therefore the
app.</p>
<p><strong>It’s hard to refactor, even harder to rewrite</strong></p>
<p>Unless it’s just a few days’ worth of messy hack code, or you have
a really good reason, prefer refactoring over rewriting (see also Joel
Spolsky’s <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html">Things You Should Never
Do</a>!)</p>
<p>Experienced developers should lead the refactoring in a hands-on
way, ensuring that newer developers are properly
supported.</p>
<p><strong>Get the infrastructure in place early</strong></p>
<p>One of the things that’s a lot better with the beta is that we
have a good infrastructure in place for things like linting, testing,
building and deploying. Edward introduced
<a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> for this. It was
definitely worth putting this in place early - it’s saved us time each
occasion we have deployed, and automated linting has picked up many
issues along the way. Having a good set of tests in place is also
invaluable if you’re doing lots of refactoring.</p>
<p><strong>Test with real users early on</strong></p>
<p>We benefitted from getting feedback from real users while
development was still ongoing. Arun, our lead designer, surveyed a
number of teachers and he visited schools to see it being used
first-hand. It was very useful to understand their expectations and
their reactions to the app. </p>
<p>We haven’t been able to address everything at this stage, but as
we are able to develop it further, it should help us to focus on what’s
most important.</p>
<h3 id="try-it-out-and-grab-the-code">Try it out and grab the code</h3>
<p>The Let’s Code! beta is
<a href="http://www.letsc.de">now live</a> for anyone to
use. At the moment, the beta is still quite limited:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can only create projects via the tutorials</li>
<li>There’s only three tutorials, based on a single scenario: the
long jump</li>
<li>The actual JavaScript code for methods is not yet editable
(although you can view it) </li>
</ul>
<p>However, we hope that it conveys the concept and you can imagine
lots of ways that it could be extended.</p>
<p>It’s an open source project <a href="https://github.com/Pearson-FutureTech/LetsCode2">freely available on Github</a>, 
to enable developers, including code-savvy teachers, to customise the app
and add their own features,
<a href="https://github.com/Pearson-FutureTech/LetsCode-v2/blob/master/docs/03_entities.md">assets</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/Pearson-FutureTech/LetsCode-v2/blob/master/docs/05_tutorials.md">tutorials</a>.
We hope to encourage the developer community to find fresh and creative
ways to extend Let’s Code! and help more young people start learning how
to code.</p>
<p>Whether you’re a teacher, student, developer, or just someone who’s interested
to take a look, we’d love your feedback, so please <a href="http://www.letsc.de">try it out</a> and 
<a href="mailto:future_tech@pearson.com">let us know what you think</a>!</p>
