    <h1>Why Angry Birds Is Like Agile Software Development</h1>
    <p class="date"><time>17th Feb 2011</time></p>
    <p><em>This is a post from an old website of mine that I thought I&#39;d lost, but I rediscovered it <a href="https://twitter.com/poshaughnessy/status/691707872690999296">thanks to the Internet Archive</a>!</em></p>
<p>--</p>
<p>It struck me earlier (while achieving 3 stars on 939/939 levels across Angry Birds &amp; Angry Birds Seasons!) that playing Angry Birds is actually a lot like Agile Software Development. Here&#39;s why:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Planning</strong>: you&#39;re best off taking a good look at the level as a whole and thinking ahead to future bird throws, but it&#39;s not worth trying to plan them all out in detail right at the start.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Accepting change</strong>: unexpected events happen; you can&#39;t know exactly how the structures will fall in advance.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Iterative &amp; incremental progress</strong>: you should take each bird in turn and keep re-assessing the situation after each one.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Prototyping</strong>: throwing out a quick bird or two can help you gain a better understanding of the problem.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Adaptability</strong>: sometimes you may be best off rethinking your strategy, even midway through a level.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Retrospectives</strong>: if you take a look back at what went well and what didn&#39;t go so well, you&#39;ll be able to rethink the bird throws that didn&#39;t score many points and turn failed levels into completed levels. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Craftmanship</strong>: tricky levels will always be difficult to get right first time, but improving your skills through practice and gaining experience helps.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Pairing up</strong>: sometimes having another pair of eyes on the problem can help to provide an idea for a solution that you never would&#39;ve thought of on your own.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Keeping track of progress</strong>: it&#39;s important that the game tells you how many levels you have completed versus how many are left to do, or else you would feel lost and unmotivated.</p>
</li>
<li><p>And finally: sometimes it&#39;s really difficult, but it&#39;s a great feeling when you finally get it right!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So now that I&#39;ve realised this, I don&#39;t feel quite so bad for having devoted countless hours of my life to this game! ;-)</p>
