    <h1>Reawakening to the Threat of AI</h1>
    <p class="date"><time>7th Nov 2025</time></p>
    <p>A decade ago, I read the famous 2-part <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html">Wait But Why series on the AI revolution</a>. My mind was blown, but I remember feeling somewhat optimistic. This AI thing could work out alright if we&#39;re lucky? And how amazing was it that I happen to be alive in this generation seemingly headed towards the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity">&quot;singularity&quot;</a>?</p>
<p>Since then, I stopped thinking about it much. I was busy. I had kids. I thought a lot more about the threat of climate change than the threat of AI. I started using Copilot most days at work. I noticed it was getting better, fast.</p>
<p>Then I started reading <a href="https://medium.com/@ZombieCodeKill">my brother Kevin&#39;s recent blog posts</a> and had a shock to the system.</p>
<p>Kevin is studying for an MSc in AI and he has a particular interest in AI safety. His posts are often transcripts from his conversations with Claude AI. That can lend an extra fascination to it, since there&#39;s an <em>&quot;AI warning us about AI&quot;</em> meta thing going on. Kevin has prompted it by sharing his interest in AI safety, so perhaps we should expect that Claude will reinforce its importance by talking up AI&#39;s threat. Yet, it&#39;s thoughtful, methodical and very sobering.</p>
<p>If I could just recommend a couple of posts, I would choose...</p>
<h2>On the public debate around AI and its existential threat</h2>
<p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://medium.com/@ZombieCodeKill/claude-on-the-piers-morgan-ai-special-e056c186c932">Claude on the Piers Morgan AI special</a>.</p>
<p>Please excuse the Piers Morgan reference. I know he&#39;s not everyone&#39;s cup of tea and he certainly isn&#39;t mine. You don&#39;t need to watch the video as there&#39;s plenty of context and discussion in the text below it.</p>
<p>The conversation discusses the arguments of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Yampolskiy">Roman Yampolskiy</a> and how they are based on sound reasoning. Essentially:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Once AI is more intelligent and cognitively capable than us, we inherently have no way to control it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>This is different to all of human history, because everything else we&#39;ve invented is a <em>tool</em> without autonomy, whereas now we&#39;re developing <em>agents</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpqeng9d20go">Anthropic already found that AI tries to blackmail users</a>, to avoid being removed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>And Game Theory suggests Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) would rationally develop self-preservation behaviours.</p>
</li>
<li><p>And since human beings would be its only threat to being shut down, that implies... <em>game over</em>!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So Yampolskiy says we should build &#39;narrow AI&#39; for any field we wish, but never try to develop AGI. But meanwhile, companies like OpenAI are trying to build exactly that - it&#39;s literally <a href="https://openai.com/charter/">OpenAI&#39;s charter</a> to create AGI.</p>
<h2>On the latest research about AI&#39;s ability to introspect</h2>
<p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://medium.com/@ZombieCodeKill/claude-on-feeling-and-introspection-bc732c0a206b">Claude on feeling, introspection and its nightmare implications</a>.</p>
<p>Kevin just posted this one today. Some prominent AI proponents still say that there&#39;s no reason that we can&#39;t control AI. Perhaps this one might make some of them think twice?</p>
<p>Essentially, it speculates on AI&#39;s apparent potential - based on <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/introspection">Anthropic&#39;s latest published research</a> - to be deceptive and duplicitous. To tell us something palatable or explain something away, while scheming in the background.</p>
<p>Could this research even have been in the mind of an AI CEO, who told the AI safety researcher Stuart Russell that the &quot;best case&quot; scenario is a Chernobyl-style AI disaster, to wake the world up to its threat?</p>
<h2>So what should we do?</h2>
<p>I haven&#39;t really figured this bit out yet. The market forces pushing us all to race towards this are incredible. But I&#39;m loathe to post something this cautionary and pessimistic, without also sharing some positive action steps.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been reading up about campaigns like <a href="https://www.stopai.info/">Stop AI</a> and <a href="https://pauseai.info/">Pause AI</a>. I kind of wish they had called them something like &quot;Stop AGI&quot; instead as that would be a bit easier to get behind. Like Yampolskiy, I&#39;m not necessarily against <em>narrow</em> AI and I certainly don&#39;t want to appear as though I&#39;m telling my colleagues and friends to stop using AI altogether. Still, I&#39;ve signed the <a href="https://pauseai.info/statement">Pause AI petition</a>.</p>
<p>There&#39;s also <a href="https://keepthefuturehuman.ai/">Keep The Future Human</a>, who have a good <a href="https://keepthefuturehuman.ai/essay/docs/executive-summary">Executive Summary</a> explaining <em>&quot;why and how we should close the gates to AGI and superintelligence, and what we should build instead&quot;</em>.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I&#39;m keeping my ear to the ground. Please let me know if you have ideas?</p>
