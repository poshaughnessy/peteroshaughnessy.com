    <h1>A beginner&#x27;s guide to digital piano recording (with Linux)</h1>
    <p class="date"><time>24th Jun 2024</time></p>
    <p>I&#39;ve recently learned the hard way how to record my digital piano. I&#39;d like to share my setup in case it helps save anyone else some of the time and hassle it took for me.</p>
<p>I personally use Linux Mint, although most of this should be transferrable to any other operating system. I&#39;ll explain why I started by recording the audio through the headphone jack, using an Audiobox GO audio interface - and switched to recording MIDI through the USB port.</p>
<p>But first, I&#39;ll jump straight to what my current setup is and how it sounds, in case you want the <em>tl;dr</em>!</p>
<h2>My working setup (MIDI)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Roland FP-10 digital piano</li>
<li>USB-B to USB-C cable (<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0769LM3BY">this one</a>)</li>
<li>Linux Mint laptop</li>
<li>Pianoteq software - for recording MIDI and exporting audio</li>
<li>Android phone - for recording the video of me playing (without audio)</li>
<li>OpenShot Video Editor - for merging the video and audio back together</li>
</ul>
<p>I found this setup fairly straightforward to get working, except for the details below. But first, here&#39;s how it actually sounds.</p>
<h2>How it sounds</h2>

<p class="caption" style="margin: 0">One I recorded earlier (Clubbed to Death by Rob Dougan, arrangement by Maxence Cyrin). Output with the Steinway Model D virtual grand piano from Pianoteq. (I'm self-taught and I only started playing in my 40s, so please try to look past the actual standard of playing!) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PeterOShaughnessy/search?query=piano">More examples here</a>.</p>

<h2>How to get it working</h2>
<h3>Realtime scheduling</h3>
<p>I needed to configure Linux to enable Realtime (RT) scheduling. To do this, I followed <a href="https://jackaudio.org/faq/linux_rt_config.html">this guide</a>.</p>
<p>So I have a file at <code>/etc/security/limits.d/audio.conf</code> with these two lines uncommented:</p>
<pre><code>@audio   -  rtprio     95
@audio   -  memlock    unlimited
</code></pre>
<p>And I setup the <code>audio</code> group and added my user to it. Please see <a href="https://jackaudio.org/faq/linux_rt_config.html">the post on jackaudio.org</a> for the full details.</p>
<h3>Pianoteq</h3>
<p>To record the MIDI and play and export it with different virtual pianos, I tried and subsequently decided to purchase <a href="https://www.modartt.com/pianoteq_stage">Pianoteq Stage</a>. It costs a fair bit, but they have a free trial so you can decide if you think it&#39;s worth it. For me, I really love the sound of the Steinway Model D grand piano in particular (that&#39;s the one I used for the recording above) and I haven&#39;t regretted it.</p>
<p>To configure Pianoteq, I followed <a href="https://forum.pianoworld.com/ubbthreads.php/topics/3162235/re-roland-fp-10-usb-to-windows-10-direct-connection-and-midi.html">a tip I read here</a>: When you first load it up, go to <code>Edit --&gt; Preferences --&gt; Devices --&gt; Active MIDI inputs</code> and check <code>Listen to all MIDI inputs</code>.</p>
<p>My audio output is set to: <code>HDA Intel PCA, ALC256 Analog; Direct hardware device without any conversions</code>.</p>
<p>Now when I have the piano plugged into the USB port of the laptop, I have the piano switched on, and I have Pianoteq open, it &quot;just works&quot; and I can see the keys I&#39;m pressing and hear how it sounds with my selected virtual piano and settings.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> Another tip, which I missed earlier myself. Do make sure you calibrate Pianoteq for your piano (the &quot;Calibration&quot; button, on the left, above the keys). I belatedly did this and it sounds much better now!</p>

<h3>OpenShot Video Editor</h3>
<p>I use <a href="https://www.openshot.org/">OpenShot</a> to combine the video recorded on my phone with the audio recorded via MIDI. OpenShot can be a bit unintuitive and even a bit buggy, but I&#39;ve managed alright with it since I made sure I was running the latest version downloaded <a href="https://www.openshot.org/download/">from the OpenShot website</a>.</p>
<p>I was worried at first that it would take me ages to sync the audio and video up exactly, but thankfully I realised that I didn&#39;t need to be super-accurate - as long as you hear the note around the time you press the key, it looks normal enough.</p>
<p>The final thing I needed to learn was which export type to select. For my camera (OnePlus Nord 3) which takes 1080p video, good options are e.g. &#39;FHD 1080p 29.97 fps (1920x1080)&#39; for landscape videos or &#39;FHD Vertical 1080p 29.97 fps (1080x1920)&#39; for portrait (depending on how high quality you want).</p>
<h2>My previous setup (audio)</h2>
<p>Before I realised MIDI was the way to go for me, I tried recording the actual audio output via the headphone jack. This is basically because I had a naive view of MIDI. I had briefly tried recording MIDI through Roland&#39;s Piano Partner 2 phone app via Bluetooth and it recorded badly and sounded bad. I didn&#39;t realise how powerful and accurate MIDI could be if I set it up properly. Now I think of MIDI a bit like a computer program I can use to re-generate the audio. I can run the &#39;program&#39; as many times as I like and change how it sounds.</p>
<p>You can even edit the MIDI to tweak things or fix mistakes if you like. I&#39;ve done this for little bits here and there when it doesn&#39;t feel too much like cheating! ;) I use a free online MIDI editor called <a href="https://signalmidi.app/">Signal</a>.</p>
<p>However, my previous setup did have one big advantage over my MIDI setup: I could record directly on my phone. I didn&#39;t need to sync up the video and audio in post-production - I didn&#39;t need to use a laptop at all. However, I much prefer the resulting sound when I do go to that effort - and the flexibility to be able to change how it sounds afterwards - so for me, it&#39;s worth it.</p>
<p>Before I learned that though, here is how I recorded the audio:</p>
<ul>
<li>Roland FP-10 digital piano</li>
<li>3.5mm to 6.35mm TRS stereo audio cable (<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08LCZSZQJ">this one</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.presonus.com/en/interfaces/usb-audio-interfaces/audiobox-series/2777700106.html">AudioBox GO audio interface</a></li>
<li>Powered USB-C hub (<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0CT4ZP72M">this one</a>) - to power the AudioBox GO and connect it to my phone</li>
<li>Android phone</li>
<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.sourceforge.opencamera&hl=en_GB">Open Camera app</a> - a free camera app which lets you select an external audio source</li>
</ul>
<p>It took me a lot of research to even figure out that I needed each of these things. Then there was one more key thing I needed to learn in order to get it working:</p>
<h3>Open Camera</h3>
<p>I needed to set the audio channel to &quot;Mono&quot; in the Open Camera video settings (<code>Settings -&gt; Video settings -&gt; Audio channels</code>). I found this counter-intuitive at first, because I was thinking &quot;I want to record stereo, not mono&quot;. But when it&#39;s set to stereo, it expects stereo input - and results in the audio only coming through in one ear!</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>That&#39;s all the key points I can think of, for how I now record my digital piano using MIDI - and how I previously recorded it using audio. I hope you might have found it useful. Happy recording!</p>
