    <h1>Working from home? Here&#x27;s 12 tips for avoiding/treating computer-related neck and wrist pain</h1>
    <p class="date"><time>26th Mar 2020</time></p>
    <p>With many more of us working from home now, I’d like to share these 12 tips for avoiding/treating computer-related neck and wrist pain. Based on personal experience over a few years. I hope they might help for some of you :)</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Don&#39;t stare down at your laptop screen</strong> on your lap or on a table. The neck strain will add up after many hours. If you can, hook up an external monitor or use a laptop stand to raise it higher, with an external keyboard and mouse. (I&#39;ve gotten on well with a Microsoft Natural keyboard and a vertical mouse).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Get a decent chair and try not to slump down</strong>. A proper office chair suitable for 8 hours a day might cost $$$ but if you can afford it / your company will pay for it and you have room for it, it should be worth it!</p>
</li>
<li><p>You could try switching to <strong>use a standing desk</strong> for a short while each day (you could use it gradually more each day as you get used to it). If you don&#39;t have the room or budget for an actual standing desk, you can get table-top ones, or you might even find a stack of boxes works OK for you for short periods!</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Take frequent breaks</strong>. Using a break reminder app could help you not to forget.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Keep your neck and wrists mobile</strong>. When I first started getting pain and stiffness I thought the answer was to immobilise them with a neck support, wrist straps etc. Turned out that was a big mistake. Keep moving, try to reach their full movement and avoid them stiffening up too much.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Do some regular neck and wrist exercises</strong>: shoulder shrugs, shoulder rolls, wrist rolls, chin tucks, head turns, head tilts, arms across your chest, hands down your spine... There are some images to depict all these in <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XveZ1qQnUmT_63PNx9Q8nqAItSzO40hKoWGvLtXdl8E/present">this presentation I gave a few years ago</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Keep doing upper body exercises</strong>. I&#39;ve tended to have trouble when I&#39;ve only been running/cycling, and avoided trouble when I&#39;ve been working my core and upper body too.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Use a spikey ball</strong>, up against a wall, roll it around the muscles in your neck and shoulders.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Avoid other activities that make it worse</strong>, e.g. staring down at your mobile phone screen, or reading for a long time in bed. Be extra careful if you do heavy lifting (mine just flared up after pulling our dishwasher out yesterday!)</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Get a good pillow</strong>. Honestly. It&#39;s amazing the difference that a decent night time&#39;s worth of rest can do for your neck versus it still being slightly strained. If you&#39;re a side or back sleeper, you might like a contoured, ergonomic one.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Try a heat patch</strong> for temporary relief if you have a flare up.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Physio?</strong> Normally I&#39;d recommend seeing one early on, but with lockdowns in place, that might not be possible. If not, try to see one after the lockdown ends!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Best wishes and let me know if you have any of your own tips you&#39;d like to share.</p>
